# Hello-world
This is really where I start.
This project was done in my summer holidays.
It is said that now a days a GitHub account is more important than a CV.
Well I am making it stronger and this is the first step.
This is just a basic version of Hello World GIT Project
PS: I have also installed git on my UBUNTU systems
